*Apple Counting in Orchards*

Task objectives can be queried [UFMFRR-15-M Machine Vision Assignment_v2](https://github.com/Solaris-star/Machine-Vision/blob/main/UFMFRR-15-M%20Machine%20Vision%20Assignment_v2.pdf) document

The goal is to use two different deep learning methods to count apples in photos of apple trees in orchards based on MinneApple, a benchmark dataset for apple detection and segmentation, (HÃ¤ni, et al., 2019) , for yield mapping of apples in orchards.

The task completion process can be found in document [MV AS1 apple_counting](https://github.com/Solaris-star/Machine-Vision/blob/main/MV%20AS1%20apple_counting.pdf)

Dataset: [MinneApple](https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/206575)

Two vision algorithms: Faster-RCNN(Two-stage) and YOLOv3(One-stage)
